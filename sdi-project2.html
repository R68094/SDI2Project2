<p>This is my second time around in this class and if it wasn't for some minor time restraints i don't think i would be retaking this course.
However i am here and im trying to better my work each week from last months failed attempt.</p>
<p>Last month i wrote about the dragon battle and this month like stated in project 1 i wanted to continue with that to really build on what i used and try and learn things i missed.
Hopefully the story flows enough to where you enjoy it just a bit while reading and this time around hopefully i can capture the minor details i missed during last months projects!</p>
